# IDEAX

Software that allows us to store our projects and track our progress on each of them.

At the moment, it is a simple Python program that allows us to organize our projects through a series of lists.

The following objectives are:
- To implement the use of files so that the history is not deleted when closing the program, but remains saved in the file.
- Implement a system of steps to follow to complete that project. The progress will be updated according to the completed steps.
